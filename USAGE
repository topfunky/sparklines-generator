Description:
    Generates a controller and helper for making sparklines graphs from a view.

    No arguments are needed.

    The generator creates a controller class in app/controllers and
    a helper in app/helpers.

    You'll need to create a route:
    
      map.resources :sparklines

Example:
    ./script/generate sparklines

    This will create:
        Controller: app/controllers/sparklines_controller.rb
        Helper:     app/helpers/sparklines_helper.rb
